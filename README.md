# Web-Application---nursing-home
The web application I created uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP and MySQL databases to create a powerful and user-friendly system for managing a nursing home.
This app is a complex system for managing a nursing home. The interface is developed using HTML and CSS, providing a pleasant and intuitive look and feel to users.Using JavaScript and jQuery, I added interactive functionality to enhance the user experience.To manage the data, I used PHP to build the server side of the application. I created a robust MySQL database management system that stores information about residents, staff, activity schedules and other relevant details.
The web application allows staff to record and update resident data, manage activity schedules. Users can also search and view information about residents, staff and more.
